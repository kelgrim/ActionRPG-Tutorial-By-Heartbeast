I followed the ActionRPG tutorial by Heartbeast. 
Highly recommend it to learn Godot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a

Godot usually uses GDScript, but I've used C# for the code. 

Note that this was the first Godot tutorial I followed, so the code could use some cleanup. 
There's also some variations on what is done in the tutorial. (For example I added a dodge timer and the possibility to interrupt an attack into dodge) 
There's also healhbars above the enmies and a lantern that spawns bats. 

Not really anything special, but I thought I'd publish it as an example of a c# Godot project. 

Any tips are always welcome.
